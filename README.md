## How to run:
- CLI written in python2

- to run use python2 viewer.py

## Notes
- viewer.py contains code to connect and pull tickets from api
- python requests needs to be installed for viewer.py to run properly
- for some reason python requests only worked on python2 on my machince hence why it is using in python2
- should work on linux or unix devices, will most likely run on windows as well
